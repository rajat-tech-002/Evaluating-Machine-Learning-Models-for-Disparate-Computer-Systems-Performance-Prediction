# Evaluating-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Disparate-Computer-Systems-Performance-Prediction
Performance prediction is an active area of research
due to its applications in the advancements of hardware-software
co-development. Several empirical machine-learning models such
as linear models, tree-based models, neural network etc are used
for performance prediction each having different prediction accuracy.
Furthermore, the prediction modelâ€™s accuracy may differ
depending on performance data collected for different software
types (compute-bound, memory-bound) and different hardware
(simulation-based or physical systems). We have studied fourteen
machine-learning models on simulation-based hardware and
physical systems by executing several benchmark programs with
different computation and data access patterns. Our results show
that the tree-based machine-learning models outperform all other
models with median absolute percentage error (MedAPE) of
less than 5% followed by bagging and boosting models that
help to improve weak learners. We have also observed that
prediction accuracy is higher on simulation-based hardware due
to its deterministic nature as compared to physical systems.
Moreover, in physical systems, prediction accuracy of memorybound
algorithms is higher as compared to compute-bound
algorithms due to manufacturer variability in processors.
